/*This is a template for how a command should be laid out so we don't lose 
our minds trying to remember the sintax.

A command is an object that interacts with the subsystems to make the robot do a certain action. The roborio can't run two functions at EXACTLY the same time, so
if you want to have a function continuously running, you should use the execute() function in a command (or a periodic() function in a subsystem.)
